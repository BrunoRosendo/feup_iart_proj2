3,lp to 8 track to cd,i have the origin verson of jesu just left chicago and he doe place quit a bit of ccchhhiiicccaaagggoo so your are part right the remast doe place a bit more but the originla had quit a bit
3,not impress,i wa abl to figur out the twist by the second chapter so i wa not realli surpris by the end while thi book wa entertain at time i did not find the charact to be particulali believ and the author s attempt at use southern dialoug were just plain awkward the author dorothi allison did it better with bastard out of carolina
3,predict saw onli the first episod,after enjoy life on mar and wire in the blood i thought i would enjoy thi seri mayb i cannot appreci the style glorifi in the other review but the plot wa pretti bore a usual plot about a clean cut high rank by the book offic di who ha just been assign to manag a bunch of slob in a dirti messi offic tri to catch a sophist serial killer sound familiar i did not find ani sort of sophist in the killer the expert the di or ani of the witti charm charisma i expect from the detect mayb it get better but think i ll spend my 1 99 somewher els

3,entertain,thi book is entertain and an easi read but i didn t rate it higher becaus it ha way too mani spell too mani thing to go out of your way to get in specialti store and too mani scent and color that you need to rememb what they are good for if you are not into the spell part and i am not and you just concentr on the stori at the end of each chapter for each night of the week and the energi of the specif goddess for each day it is interest but then there s no need to read half the book
3,some memor footag,i don t regret purchas thi dvd and have watch it sever time unfortun the commentari on most wildlif film rang from insipidli trite to downright annoy thi seem crimin given the qualiti of the movi footag and the tribul involv in captur it on thi one the monologu is mostli innoffens although the qualiti dure the introduct ha the appear of an old video the rest of the film is fine while not in the same leagu as say derek beverey joubert there is some memor and engag footag in place and i will certainli be watch it again

3,overstereotyp punk,thi movi look like an mtv produc video concentr on just how cynic and violent punk rocker are not to mention the main charact a rich colleg boy with blue hair thi film tri to say all punk do is drink beer smoke pot and beat up redneck plu stev o rambl on and on and on about anarchi and rebellion can someon pleas tell me just what he wa be so rebelli against or just what anarchist principl did he hold it is a good film to sit down and watch discuss and laugh at but it realli doe noth more than streotyp punk also it jerk your emot around constantli from a funni satir to an emot studi of self discoveri in the end steve o becom what he complain about through the whole film noth more than a poser all along at least he admit it
3,adult onli,i like when a movi is advertis for what it is actual about i don t like gori war movi made to look like they are a fantasi movi although thi movi is good the ad made it look like anoth fantasi movi i am give it three star becaus of the poor job of promot the movi be warn it is more like photograph fairi than a children movi i happen to like thi type of movi but i felt thi wa a touch more brutal than necessari i like the grimm fairi tale but that doesn t mean i need to see the gore in my face to enjoy movi of them thi is rate r so that should be your first clue the fantasi stori sprinkl in amongst the horror did not appeal to the side of me that enjoy movi like princess bride and labyrinth although the stori is good i don t think you need to slice someon mouth with a razor blade and brutal beat peopl to make it s point

3,he may be the duke but,as other review have mention dukemini s textbook is the most common book for properti lead one to believ that hi outlin should be a natur choic in light of how much i pay for law school tuition i decid to get some insur by purchas gilbert s and emanuel s outlin for most class and use the best of each for my cours work as a side effect of that i wa abl to do a comparison between the two and i wa surpris that emanuel s consist gave deeper and broader treatment of subject especi in properti and contract although duke s outlin is certainli use i strongli believ that you can do better with emanuel s which is also key to duke s textbook
3,it s just like the origin robotech seri but differ,an acction fill tale about the origin of the sdf 1 you will join rick hunter lisa hay and all the old crew on their quest to confront the robotech master but along the way there will be mani exit and thrill surpris such as the introduct of the invid and their robot hord known as the organ if you are a fan of the origin robotech becaus of the mecha you will be exit to know that the sdf 3 is eqip with a whole new line of robotech weaponri that will make your mouth water such as the logan and the formid cyclon there is even two upgrad of the origin veritech known as the alpha and beta they can combin togeth to make a nearli invivc mecha combo all togeth robotech ii the sentin will keep even the most loyal origin robotech fan on the edg of their seat

3,it doesn t build basic vocabulari,the vocabulari it build is more casual vocabulari i did not know that when i bought it but the reason for the 3 star rate is the pictur on mani strip the pictur are the same from one scene to the next not give mani contectu cue it is interest becaus in the prefac to the book it state that as an import featur of the book then it doesn t follow the featur there is at least one sequenc that is almost the same from the top of the bottom all the way to the bottom of the page with just differ mouth move what can of contetu cue are suppos to be gather from that

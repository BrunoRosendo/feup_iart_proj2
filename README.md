# Natural Language Processing with Amazon Reviews

## Setup & Installation

1. Install python3 and the necessary packages
2. To run `proProcessBagOfWords.ipynb`, you need to [download the spreadsheet files](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yacharki/amazon-reviews-for-sentianalysis-finegrained-csv) that exceed GitHub's limit.
3. There are some `test` and `train` spreadsheet files already generated if you want to skip step 2.
